    <h1>Revolutionizing Oncology: The Transformative Role of AI in Cancer Care</h1>
    <div class="section">
        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly reshaping cancer care, offering oncologists powerful tools to enhance diagnosis, personalize treatment, and improve patient outcomes. Recent reports highlight several key advancements:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. Early Detection & Diagnosis</h2>
        <p>AI-driven imaging analysis (e.g., deep learning algorithms for radiology) now outperforms human experts in identifying tumors from CT/MRI scans, enabling earlier intervention.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. Personalized Treatment</h2>
        <p>Machine learning models analyze genomic data and clinical histories to predict response to therapies, guiding precision oncology decisions. AI also optimizes radiation therapy planning, reducing side effects.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. Drug Discovery Acceleration</h2>
        <p>AI-powered platforms streamline drug candidate screening, cutting development timelines by up to 60% and identifying novel targets for rare cancers.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. Patient Monitoring & Support</h2>
        <p>Natural language processing (NLP) tools now extract critical insights from electronic health records, while AI chatbots provide real-time support for symptom management and adherence.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <p><strong>However, challenges remain</strong>, including data privacy concerns, algorithmic bias, and integration into clinical workflows. As AI adoption grows, collaboration between clinicians, data scientists, and regulators will be essential to maximize its potential. The future of oncology lies in harnessing these technologies to deliver smarter, more compassionate care.</p>
