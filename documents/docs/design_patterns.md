# Design Patterns in Astra

The Astra framework is built upon a foundation of proven software design patterns to ensure it is robust, scalable, and easy to understand. This document outlines the key patterns used and how they contribute to the framework's architecture.

## Core Architectural Patterns

### 1. Blackboard Pattern

-   **Purpose**: To provide a centralized space for different components (agents) to share information and collaborate on a problem.
-   **Implementation**: The `SessionState` class serves as the blackboard. It holds the `history` of the conversation and a `data` dictionary that acts as a shared memory space. Agents can read from and write to the `SessionState`, allowing for seamless communication and context sharing without being directly coupled to one another.

### 2. Strategy Pattern

-   **Purpose**: To define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.
-   **Implementation**: The `BaseAgent` class defines the common interface (the "strategy") for all agents. Each concrete agent class (`LLMAgent`, `SequentialAgent`, etc.) provides a specific implementation of the `execute` method. This allows the `WorkflowManager` to run any agent without knowing its specific type, promoting flexibility and extensibility.

### 3. Facade Pattern

-   **Purpose**: To provide a simplified interface to a larger body of code.
-   **Implementation**: The `WorkflowManager` class acts as a facade for the entire framework. It provides a simple, high-level API for registering workflows (`register_workflow`), creating sessions (`create_session`), and running workflows (`run`). This hides the internal complexity of session management and agent execution from the end-user.

## Composite and Agent-Specific Patterns

### 4. Composite Pattern

-   **Purpose**: To compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. The composite pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
-   **Implementation**: The `SequentialAgent`, `ParallelAgent`, and `LoopAgent` are all examples of the composite pattern. They are agents that contain other agents (their "children"). This allows you to build complex workflows by composing simpler agents into sequences, parallel executions, or loops.

### 5. Chain of Responsibility Pattern

-   **Purpose**: To pass a request along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.
-   **Implementation**: The `SequentialAgent` implements a form of the chain of responsibility pattern. It executes its child agents in a specific order, with the output of one agent becoming the input for the next.

### 6. Template Method Pattern

-   **Purpose**: To define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses.
-   **Implementation**: The `BaseAgent`'s `execute` method can be seen as a template method. While it's an abstract method, it defines the basic signature for all agent execution logic. Concrete agent classes then provide the specific implementation for this method.
